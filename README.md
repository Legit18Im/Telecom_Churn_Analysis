## 📝 Project Summary

Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, especially subscription-based companies. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and predicting customer churn based on various attributes like tenure, contract type, payment method, monthly charges, and more.

The project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics and service usage patterns.
- Building multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict whether a customer will churn or not.
- Performing feature selection and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- Evaluating models using classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores.
- Interpreting important features influencing churn decisions.
- Providing actionable business recommendations to reduce churn rate and increase revenue.

All analysis was performed using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
